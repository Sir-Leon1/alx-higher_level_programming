## [0x00-python-hello_world/](0x00-python-hello_world/)
Introduction to **Python** programming, covering the basics such as printing to the console, using comments, and understanding the interpreter.

## [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/](0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/)
Covers control flow in **Python** including `if` statements, loops (`for` and `while`), and defining and using functions.

## [0x02-python-import_modules/](0x02-python-import_modules/)
Explains how to import and use modules in **Python**, including built-in modules and creating custom modules.

## [0x03-python-data_structures/](0x03-python-data_structures/)
Introduction to **Python** data structures such as lists, tuples, and sets. Covers basic operations and common methods.

## [0x04-python-more_data_structures/](0x04-python-more_data_structures/)
Builds on the previous module with more advanced data structures such as dictionaries and deeper insights into lists and sets.

## [0x05-python-exceptions/](0x05-python-exceptions/)
Focuses on error handling in **Python** using try/except blocks, raising exceptions, and creating custom exception classes.

## [0x06-python-classes/](0x06-python-classes/)
Introduction to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **Python**. Covers defining classes, creating objects, and understanding methods and attributes.

## [0x07-python-test_driven_development/](0x07-python-test_driven_development/)
Explains the concept of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Covers writing tests using `unittest` and ensuring code correctness through tests.

## [0x08-python-more_classes/](0x08-python-more_classes/)
Advanced topics in **OOP**. Covers inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more complex class structures.

## [0x09-python-everything_is_object/](0x09-python-everything_is_object/)
Deep dive into **Python**'s object model. Explains that everything in **Python** is an object, including functions, classes, and modules.

## [0x0A-python-inheritance/](0x0A-python-inheritance/)
Focuses on inheritance in **OOP**. Covers single and multiple inheritance, method overriding, and using `super()`.

## [0x0B-python-input_output/](0x0B-python-input_output/)
Covers file handling in **Python**. Explains reading from and writing to files, using context managers, and handling different file formats.

## [0x0D-SQL_introduction/](0x0D-SQL_introduction/)
Introduction to **SQL** and database management. Covers basic **SQL** commands, database creation, and performing **CRUD** operations.
